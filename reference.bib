  abstract = "{We estimate the effect of minimum wages on low-wage jobs using
              138 prominent state-level minimum wage changes between 1979 and
              2016 in the United States using a difference-in-differences
              approach. We first estimate the effect of the minimum wage increase
              on employment changes by wage bins throughout the hourly wage
              distribution. We then focus on the bottom part of the wage
              distribution and compare the number of excess jobs paying at or
              slightly above the new minimum wage to the missing jobs paying
              below it to infer the employment effect. We find that the overall
              number of low-wage jobs remained essentially unchanged over the
              five years following the increase. At the same time, the direct
              effect of the minimum wage on average earnings was amplified by
              modest wage spillovers at the bottom of the wage distribution. Our
              estimates by detailed demographic groups show that the lack of job
              loss is not explained by labor-labor substitution at the bottom of
              the wage distribution. We also find no evidence of disemployment
              when we consider higher levels of minimum wages. However, we do
              find some evidence of reduced employment in tradeable sectors. We
              also show how decomposing the overall employment effect by wage
              bins allows a transparent way of assessing the plausibility of
              estimates.}",
